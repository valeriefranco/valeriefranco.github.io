What follows 
In attendance


    <i>If
    characters are not present
    then</i>


I’d like you to study the previously enclosed space in an attempt to compensate 
for an encountered lack. Point to both a cemented linearity in presence. And a cyclical one 
in its replacement.    


As an encounter: I’d like you to


Insert results from an algorithmically distilled vocalization. Extract tonalities from an 
insignificant representation. Expose an interior previously unseen


    (A granulated synthesis fragmented from a digital pace of a body. 
    A mark translated. 
    Its calculated(-ing) makeup <i>leaks</i> through a gated threshold that has already 
    reached a point of capacity. It trickles down into a metallic clearance with unsubstantiated 
    motivation. No new information is created, but the physicality of the body pushes through 
    in that emptiness.)


And subsequently confront a new set of synaptically (dis)placed contingencies.


Now let it go 
and remember


    <i>else
    contained shortcomings of two characters
    then</i>

    To reveal a presence previously concealed, trace the overarching progression that 
    used to be. 
    Various mournings, spatially resonant. I’d like you to recall these cued voices.

“Her body is monitored to fit perfectly above the baseline—

to remotely track her but to also keep her on track, interrupting the flow of her experience to prompt her – when an algorithmic analysis of her own real-time data deems it necessary – to eat, drink, or rest.
– to __, ____, or ____. 

*A post-

she is a somatic individual that aspires to be autonomous. Embraces responsibility for her body and the choices she makes for it. Short-circuited responsibility: the more time she spends with her data doppelgänger, the more familiar she becomes.

She builds herself a picture of what it is she’s really doing. Letting herself see and understand the choices she thinks she’s making on a daily basis. This of course is a picture of who she really is. She imposes onto herself an intimate modulated surveillance, in the name of self-care.”


(A practice of surrogacy: and so if I reduce myself to just a number. A number based on statistic, a baseline, I can live forever. Continuously tracked. Packed within a digital repository.)

1. I have an endless desire to supplement an absence, a lack.
2. I mourn my own various absences.
3. A longing for an autonomous self completion coming from an image of the other.
4. The awareness of this gap, a two finger difference.
5. It’s a structural difference, not a lack of artifice. The congenital chest wall deformity, absent.

        A heterogeneous set that includes virtually anything, linguistic and nonlinguistic. Under the same heading: discourses, institutions, buildings, laws, police measures, philosophical proposi­tions, and so on. The apparatus itself is the net­work that is established between these elements. The apparatus always has a concrete strate­gic function and is always located in a power relation. 
         Giorgio Agamben, What is An Apparatus?, 3. 
         
        The performance is an ongoing piece, its beginning is marked by the act of self-medication. I take my daily anti-inflammatory pill for my foot, followed by one for my stomach. This small act mirrors the cycle of what follows. 
         
        A sound piece plays in the background, on repeat. It is a documentation of a one-way conversation led by my mother. The conversation, in short, briefly mentions my general doctor losing/never having my medical documents as my mother tonally expresses (the sound is only fully accessible to those who speak spanish) the frustrations of the medical institution as she attempts to obtain referrals so that I can see the specialists I have been seeing bi-anually since I was 5.
      
        Xylene, DMSO, acetone and chloroform. These chemicals are used to extract the ink from the medical documents, after I’ve finally obtained them.

        Performed in the Dean’s office, I attempt to create parallels between medical and school institutions. Leveling them both as systems that capture one’s body as the creation of inaccessible documents. The Dean’s office exists as a mythological sacred space, as the core of a system that withholds and stores the capture of your subject. However, you come to realize that a space like this is non-existent, these systems are strong because of their scattered, and de-centralized nature. The data of a body is what keeps an institution running, the apparatus is contingent on this data. The document itself has no value, and is brought back to its original material form. I will not be able to get access to the original, physical form of these documents again as they will now only exist in a digital, virtually inaccessible form. As a way of making the medical system tangible again for myself, I go through this complicated and toxic procedure, knowing that I couldn’t change anything or re-gain agency of an apparatus that I had never had any inital power over. After the ink is removed, the paper is put back into a system of access and bureaucracy. They are placed in an institutional printer, put back into the same cycle so that another body can be captured, subjectified, categorized.
         
          
         
          This ends part two. ---
